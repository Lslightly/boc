# Behaviour-Oriented Concurrency

Package boc is a Go implementation of OOPSLA 2023 paper ["When Concurrency Matters: Behaviour-Oriented Concurrency"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3622852).

This package is rewritten from https://github.com/Lslightly-courses/cs431/blob/main/homework/src/boc.rs. The benchmark is provided by https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431 and rewritten in Go. 

Use `go doc -all` to see all documentation.

> Thanks for authors of the [course cs431](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs431) and [paper](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3622852). I'm just an implementer.
